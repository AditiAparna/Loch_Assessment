- **Call-to-Action Textbox:** Interactive effects on hover and click.
- **Email Validation:** Shows "Please enter a valid email." if the input lacks "@" or ".".

## Mobile UI Design Approach

For the mobile experience, the sign-up section is prioritized at the top to maximize user engagement. The features list is presented as a carousel at the bottom, capturing attention without detracting from the primary sign-up functionality.
